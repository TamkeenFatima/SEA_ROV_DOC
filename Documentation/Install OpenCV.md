# TASK 1

## Install OpenCV
1. Create virtual environment
2. Install OpenCV using pip

## Resources
### 1. Virtual Environment
A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated python virtual environments for them. This is one of the most important tools that most of the Python developers use. [Learn more](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/)
### 2. Computer Vision
Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision)
### 3. Open CV
OpenCV (Open source computer vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.[1] Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez (which was later acquired by Intel[2]). The library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source BSD license. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCV)

## Steps Involved
### 1. Create Virtual Environment
